## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### Database Model
```sql
-- Existing table in Prisma schema
model Hydration {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String
  amountMl  Int
  takenAt   DateTime
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  @@index([userId, takenAt])
  @@map("hydration")
}
```

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /hydration` - Create hydration entry
- ✅ `GET /hydration/summary?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Get daily summary with total liters

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. **User visits nutrition page** → sees hydration widget at top
2. **Taps +250ml or +500ml** → instant UI update + API call
3. **Views daily total** → shows current liters consumed  
4. **Taps "Undo Last"** → removes most recent entry
5. **Data syncs** → works offline with pending sync state

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Offline-first**: Full queue/sync in CX-004
- **Custom amounts**: Add custom ml input option
- **Goals**: User-configurable daily hydration targets
- **Charts**: Hydration trends and weekly patterns
- **Reminders**: Push notifications for hydration goals
